Hi Kevin,

>And as well as the attachments we have to think about the UI itself.

Yes, absolutely. But since we are also wanting to show that a desktop
does all the right things to feel like it belongs there, then we should
do all the little things that make an app really feel like it fits into the desktop
- We should have a customised dock icon
- We can add an icon to the System Tray and folks can use that to access
   the mail app and access common tasks like write a new message.
- "About" and things like that should be customised too.
- Oh and when it launches a splash screen would be good so that it is
 instant feedback whilst mail is being loaded ..
