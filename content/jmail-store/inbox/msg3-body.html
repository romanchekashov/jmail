Hi Kevin,

> Yes, let's talk about tomorrow over Zoom maybe.

Sure, that'll work for me.

We want to make sure the demo hits some of the points
we've highlighted we'd like to cover.

Emphasis should be on the UI and deployment of a desktop app,
using the best of both Swing and JavaFX and desktop integration.
