ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND by Lewis Caroll

     CHAPTER V Advice from a Caterpillar

The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in 
silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out 
of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
Who are YOU? said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.
Alice replied, rather shyly,
I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know who I WAS 
when I got up this morning, but I think I must have 
been changed several times since then.
What do you mean by that? said the Caterpillar sternly.
Explain yourself!

I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir, said Alice,
because I'm not myself, you see.

I don't see said the Caterpillar.
